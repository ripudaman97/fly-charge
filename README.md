WinHacks-2022-Hackathon


This project is created as part of WinHacks 2022 Hackathon.

The problem statement is as follows:

***************************************************
Invest Windsor Essex wants to speed up the transition from conventional
gas vehicles to zero emission vehicles which help to protect the
environment.
In order to do that, theyâ€™re looking for ways to optimize the availability of
electric vehicle chargers in the region.
Your task is to build a tool that will help them determine the location of
newly built chargers across Windsor / Essex. The best solution will take
into account multiple different factors to maximize the effectiveness of this
initiative.

Steps to Run the project
************************

1. Clone the repo into your local
2. Go into fly-charge-ui and open command prompt, type ng serve --open
3. This will run the frontend and open google browser at http://localhost:4200/
4. Go to the folder fly-charge-api, and run the route.py file
5. The flask application will start running on at http://localhost:5000/
6. Now, you can test the application using the UI

The web application will take as input the number of charging stations that you intend to install and then return the GPS location of suitable places.

Note: Make sure you have done all the configurations before running the application (angular, python)
